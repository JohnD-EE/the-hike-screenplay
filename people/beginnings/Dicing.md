# Dicing

### Options:
@Danny Connors ready to roll a dice to chose one of 6 options. Scrawling out the below on a notepad.  Glass of Whiskey in hand, dark and mood, POV...

1. Suicide
2. Meditation silent retreat
3. Call (love interest)
4. Empty bank account (£4,500), go to casino, toss coin for green or red
5. Go Hiking - Wild Camping
6. Spend the £4,500 on a Peruvian Ayahuasca ceremony

After the list is written, the dice is rolled and lands on (1). The list is torn from the notepad and thrown at the wall.  Shortly afterwards it is retrieved and unfurled for a second roll, this time landing on (5).

Next, he grabs a tablet and starts searching for tents.
