# the-hike-screenplay
Using obsidian to write a screenplay...

### Basic Ideas
- The protagonist is a man in mid-life, taking a break from the trivialities of his daily life and responsibilities to go on a solo hike.
- Despite it being a solo hike, he is accompanied by an array of co-hikers.
- He is the only one carrying a back-pack and gear, the other hikers are not suitably dressed for hiking and come and go as he is walking.
- The idea is that the co-hikers are in is imagination, people from his past, or imaginary people in his head, with whom he has internal conversations.
- The other people also represent different aspects of his personality.
- His unstated and subtle goal during the hike is to go through what Jung would call individuation - integrating these shadow aspects of his personality.
- The screenplay is heavily dialogue focused. Philosophical ponderings and deep conversations.
- The drama and moments of suspense play out as he kills off, one-by-one the characters who haunt him, the negative sides of his shadow.
- There is a love interest too.  In his daily life he has suppressed the positive parts of his personality - his kind, caring, nurturing side.  He is a cynic like Phil Connors in Groundhog Day. But he projects this shadow onto the love interest, whom he must also integrate in order to complete the individuation process.
